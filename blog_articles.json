      "description": "Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is set along the Danube River by the border with Austria and Hungary. Itâ€™s surrounded by vineyards and the Little Carpathian mountains, crisscrossed with forested hiking and cycling trails. The pedestrian-only, 18th-century old town is known for its lively bars and cafes. Perched atop a hill, the reconstructed Bratislava Castle overlooks old town and the Danube."
